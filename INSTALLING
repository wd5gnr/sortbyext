To install:

sudo mv sortbyext /usr/local/bin
sudo cp sortbyext /usr/local/share/sortbyext/sortbyext.conf
mv sortbyext.conf ~/.config/sortbyext.conf

You may want to customize ~/.config/sortbyext.conf to suit your needs

To run automatically on a directory called /home/user/Downloads type:

incrontab -e

And add the following line (also in incrontab.txt)
/home/user/Downloads IN_MOVED_TO /usr/local/bin/sortbyext -d $@ $@/$#

You may or may not want to add the -m option depending on your tastes
(see readme.md for details).
